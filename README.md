# tydig

**Ty**pst, **d**ecentralized collaboration with **i**roh, saved in **g**it.

Self-hosted collaborative Typst environment for lab and multi-institution
paper writing: projects with directories and many files, live preview,
real-time multi-cursor editing, anchored comments with preview pins,
institutional SSO, post-quantum signed checkpoints, and just-driven builds
that compute every number in the manuscript. No external services, no
telemetry; preview fonts embedded in the wasm.

The organising idea is the **pre-registered report**: you write the paper --
including the discussion of every possible outcome -- before the results
exist. Values come from the analysis, and the prose branches on them.

The 'gist' of the idea:

```typst
#let R = json("build/results.json")

The water was found to be
#if R.T1 > R.T2 [cooling] else if R.T1 == R.T2 [constant] else [heating]
when in contact with ambient air (#R.T_ambient degC).
```

## Run it

```sh
just
```
